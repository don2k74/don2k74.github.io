I am a sophomore at SNHU to get my bachelors degree in game programming and development. 
Due to having to take numerous general education courses, I have only took a course in Python and a course in Java.
I have completed two certificate courses at freecodecamp for Responsive Web Design and JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.
I have completed three certificate courses at codecademy for Learn HTML Learn Game Development with Phaser.js and Learn CSS.
I am currently working on the Create Video Games with Phaser.js Skill Path certificate at codecademy.
My next step at codecademy is the Career Path certificate in Full-Stack Engineer
My next term at SNHU is C# and dotnet development. The following term is computer graphics.
I am planning to start freelancing.
