I am still learning to code, working on building my website as I learn.
I am currently a student at Southern New Hampshire University getting my bachelor's degree in game programming and development.
It will still be a while before I start my gaming courses due to general education courses and the other programming courses.
I am also taking a certificate course in html and css through https://www.freecodecamp.org I have 3 projects left in that course. I have not decided which of their course i am taking next yet.
I have already took a Python course at SNHU and start my Java course October 23rd.
I have already registered 3 domain names and paid for hosting for a year. 
All the domain name as the same name just different extentions. Knowledge Forge Games  the .me is set to my github account my .com will be set to my game development website and the .tech will be for my freelance portfolio until I get my game company going. I have not decided what I will use it for yet after that.
